# Heart-Failure-Prediction-Project

This is a project I made to showcase some Python based data analysis, regression, classification, and model building. The project revolves around a research article from 2020 about “serum creatinine and ejection fraction” being effective heart failure prediction factors for machine learning. I wanted to test this out and did some classification and tried to do some regression of my own. In terms of classification the project came out promisingly.

Although the dataset here would be considered a classification dataset, I still performed some regression functions on this to test out any potential findings.

The Jupyter notebook itself is very detailed and organized. Please take your time looking through the entire project work.
